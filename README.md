## Sails && Pirates.

Sails and Pirates is a proyect intentded to be a tiny blog to document about maritime piracy, privateers and bucaneers that ocurred between the 17th to the 19th Century. The Site is intended to be a source of information for all those people who have interest on pirates documents and information, and for anyone who would like to read about facts that took place back then.

## Wrapper-1st-section-intro

This is intended to give content to the main site as sections that will give the user notions of what the site covers. Each section is intended to add new information unrelated to the previous one but in context to the site.

## Bugs and Features to implement

Currently the proyect is far from being finished. 
-The Footer needs to be added to every route.
-The Second navigation route, [Names&Ships] needs to be fixed as I am intended to display Cards of 6 famous pirates but need to work on the styles as bugs have not yet been fixed.
-Subscription Form needs to be implemented. 
-Unable to load Fonts locally. 

Run out of time !!
