                    <p>"Maritime Piracy has been quite a remarkable part of the Early 17th century to 18th's European history.
                 Maritime Commerce no doubt played a key role in every trading company Europeans Established every time territorial exploration and expansion was accomplished either by the British Empire, The Spanish Conquistadors or the Portuguese Explorers.
                 The West Indies Company was established in the mid 17th century to counter the Spanish and Portuguese expansion by striking their colonies in South America and the coast of Africa. 
                 While achieving success against the Portuguese in Brazil,the company dissolved in early18th Century.
                 It was at this point in history when Spanish and Portuguese wanted to protect their claims on new land and overseas ports and settlements against any other european nation 
                 who didn't want to share their fair share of these undiscovered lands known collectively as the "New World".
                 Into this arena came the West India Companies, buccaneers (or privateers, if you prefer) who preyed on Spanish and Portuguese settlements and ships.
                 This meant a perpetual state of war existed in the Caribbean Sea and South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans 
                 -- conflict that was often substantiated as "No peace beyond the line."</p>

                    <p>"Asian Pirates are not as well known by Europeans Historians. Perhaps due to the fact that the British Empire Colonies were located in other areas.
                        However, Portuguese colonies had been established in Macao and most important routes sailed to India. The Spanish who also had had colonies in the Phillipines until the early 20th Century and maintained maritime routes with their metropolis.
                        The Strait of Malaca was well known to be a menace for boat owners and for sailors who traveled and had comercial interests through this sea route. It was in these waters where the Spice Trade was prey to  Asian Pirates, especially from the Quing Dynasty.
                        Chinese pirates were strong in the area from mid 18th Century until early 19th century,leading a piracy confederation that challenged local governments and terrorized merchant ships that crossed these waters, mostly located in the area that covered Hongkong to Malaysia.
                        The imperial Chinese, British, and Portuguese navies where threatened by a very well organised confederation in the South China Sea under six different divisions each led by an independent commander from Hong to Vietnam, as well as South China and Malaysia.
                        A particular pirate hotspot was known to be in the Canton Area. Coastal towns were either attacked, looted or even encouraged the payment of protection money".
