             <h1>History Background</h1>
             <p>"Maritime Piracy has been quite a remarkable part of the Early 17th century to 18th's European history.
                 Maritime Commerce no doubt played a key role in every trading company Europeans Established every time territorial exploration and expansion was accomplished either by the British Empire, The Spanish Conquistadors or the Portuguese Explorers.
                 The West Indies Company was established in the mid 17th century to counter the Spanish and portuguese expansion by striking their colonies in South America and the coast of Africa. 
                 While achieving success against the Portuguese in Brazil,the company dissolved in early18th Century.
                 It was at this point in history when Spanish and Portuguese wanted to protect their claims on new land and overseas ports and settlements against any other european nation 
                 who didn't want to share their fair share of these undiscovered lands known collectively as the "New World".
                 Into this arena came West India companies, buccaneers (or privateers, if you prefer) who preyed on Spanish and Portuguese settlements and ships.
                 This meant a perpetual state of war existed in the Caribbean Sea and South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans 
                 -- conflict that was often substantiated as "No peace beyond the line."</p>
